# todo-list

This Todo List web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them as needed. Users can simply type their tasks into the input field and click "Add Task" to add them to the list. Completed tasks can be marked by clicking on them, and tasks can be deleted by clicking the delete button next to each task. The number of tasks remaining is displayed at the top of the page and updates dynamically. Contributions to this project are welcome through pull requests, and it is licensed under the MIT License.
